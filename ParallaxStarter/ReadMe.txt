CIS 580 Final Game Project
By: Skyler Kring and Joseph Brakey

Controls:
For this game you can either use the arrow keys or the 'wasd' keys to move your player throughout the map.

Objectives:
The objective of the game is to navigate to the end of the labrynth without colliding with its barriers. 

Our project makes use of concepts like the flyweight pattern, 2D Bitmap array for creating our maze, spritesheet animation, parallax scrolling, and a few other minor topics.
